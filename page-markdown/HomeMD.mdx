# Hi, I'm Mike and welcome to my website/blog!

I'm a full-stack developer based in the US.
I like Typescript and Elixir. You can usually find me
coding in one or the other, unless I'm having an adventure somewhere.
Sometimes, I might even write about what I'm doing on here.

You check out some of my projects on my [github](https://github.com/mgrog),
or you can check out my [CV](cv), or check out some of my blog [posts](posts).
