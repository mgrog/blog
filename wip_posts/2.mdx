## Mess up your prototype so you don't do it on the real thing

So you have a nice idea with some potential. You need an app, and you need it yesterday.
But you don't have a lot of resources, you don't have a lot of time, you can't spend a fortune on server hosting, and it needs to just work so you don't spend your nights fixing it.
It's a tall order. You need a tech stack that lets you protoype fast, scale easily, and do it all without drowning you in maintenance and complexity.

I'm not going to bury the lede, the answer is Elixir and Phoenix.
If you don't believe me, I invite you to read how [some](https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-scaled-elixir-to-5-000-000-concurrent-users) well-known [companies](https://www.quastor.org/p/how-whatsapp-scaled-to-1-billion?s=r)
did exactly that using some technology a couple of smart guys [built in the 80's](https://dockyard.com/blog/2018/07/18/all-for-reliability-reflections-on-the-erlang-thesis).
But if you want the short version, there's only one way to be fast in the web world, and that's **concurrency**.
Most of the time a webserver is just waiting for things. Waiting for a network call, waiting for the db, waiting for I/O. A webserver's life is to hurry up and wait.
So unless you can let the computer do other things while it's waiting, it's eventually going to slow down.
And that's where the underpinings of elixir (BEAM/OTP) really shine. It's [really, really good](https://phoenixframework.org/blog/the-road-to-2-million-websocket-connections) at doing a whole lot at the same time.
Concurrency is generally a hard problem in computer science, but when you start with an entire programming model built around the concept, it becomes easy.
Such is the way of things in the Elixir world.

But I'm not one for lectures and theory. It's time to build something and see if this hype stands up to reality.
I'm going to build a chat app. It sounds simple but you'd be surprised at how many things it touches.
It's going to have websockets, a database, user signup and authentication, and integrate a React frontend.
And Phoenix is going to do all of it. I'm going to be honest, I make some mistakes.
Instead of rewriting history, I'm going to call them out and explain why and what I'd do in hindsight.
Hopefully it will inspire you to make better choices. Or maybe it won't. But that's ok, we're all learning here.

### Trouble out the gate

So before writing any code, I had to reconcile with the fact that Elixir and Phoenix are still young and changing.
Phoenix versions post 1.3 are substantially different than the versions before it.
It's a complete reorg of the framework that separates web functionality and internal business code.
I won't go too far into it, but post 1.3 you need to organize your code into contexts which are a bit like elixir protocols for interfacing with your app.
The idiom is a little vague by design, as it leaves some choices up to you, but the phoenix hexdocs give a pretty good explanation to get you thinking in the right direction.
The main point is, if you see some old elixir code snippets that don't make sense, it's likely pre 1.3 code. It's something that stumped me a bit early on.
