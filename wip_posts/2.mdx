# Howto: Make This Website

A while back I had an idea for a blog that was mostly a banner with cool parallax and some markdown thrown in.
So when I learned that most parallax in the wild was still janky javascript animations,
and that css parallax, while supported in most browsers, was anything but standardized with various gotchas and inconsistencies,
you might be inclined to think that I dismissed the idea, being the reasonable and pragmatic engineer that I surely am.

Not I, dear reader. I am stubborn enough to work through vexing inconsistencies and bugs and bang my head against this problem
until there is either a 3d bending illusion, or a pile of broken dreams.
