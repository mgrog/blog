# Howto: Make This Website Banner

A while back I had an idea for a blog that was mostly a banner with cool parallax and some markdown thrown in.
So when I learned that most parallax in the wild was still janky javascript animations,
and that css parallax, while supported in most browsers, was anything but standardized with various gotchas and inconsistencies,
you might be inclined to think that I dismissed the idea, being the reasonable and pragmatic engineer that I surely am.

Not I, dear reader. I am stubborn enough to plow through such annoyances. Come bugs, wonky browser support, hell or high water, there would be a
performant parallax banner on my website, _damnit_. If you are of the same mindset, I can tell you it won't be easy, but it is **possible**.

### Why would you go and do a thing like that?

First off, we should touch on why you should care about any of this to begin with. A javascript solution would work on a variety of browsers without
many differences and would seem easier to implement. And that would be right, **_if_** we were going for the janky slideshow aesthetic.
The poor javascript thread running on your browser would try it's best to keep up and get left in the dust when you flick the screen away on your mobile device.

CSS has a secret weapon: the GPU. The browser can tap into it's awesome power when we keep everything in CSS, and with few exceptions
(the excellent [React Spring](https://react-spring.io/) comes to mind), this is the only way to get smooth effects. And smooth effects should be our goal.

### Study Materials

The primer on CSS parallax can be found in the blog post: [Performant Parallaxing](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/performant-parallaxing/),
written by a couple of Google Chrome engineers. There are many golden nuggets of information is this post that I will touch on later. But I would
recommend reading it and point out one thing that was not true in my experience, namely, that mobile Safari would not work unless you add `position: sticky`
which then reverses the effect (yikes).

Thankfully, this did not happen on my mobile ios device.

### You expect me to read that?

Ok fine, let me sum up the basics for you. To make this work:

- The scroll body needs `overflow: scroll`, `perspective: [some amount]`, and `perspective-origin: top left`.
  In this case we are using 1px as the reference distance

- The child elements need to be wrapped in a container with `transform-style: preserve3d` (for firefox to work)

- The parallaxing elements must have `translate-z: [some amount]` in proportion to it's distance in the background

Let's look at some example code:

```javascript
export const Perspective = styled('div', {
  perspective: 1,
  perspectiveOrigin: 'top left',
  overflowX: 'hidden',
  overflowY: 'scroll',
  '-webkit-overflow-scrolling': 'touch',
  width: '100vw',
  height: '100vh',
  backgroundColor: '#121212',
  backfaceVisibility: 'hidden',
  scrollBehavior: 'smooth',
});
```

<br />

```javascript
export const Preserve = styled('div', {
  transformStyle: 'preserve-3d',
  height: 500,
  width: '100vw',
  overflowX: 'visible',
});
```

<figure>
  I'm using the excellent [stitches](https://stitches.dev/) library for my flavor of css-in-js
</figure>

### Wait, what's 'backfaceVisibility'?

Don't worry, we'll get to that.

Now here comes the fiddly part:

You must position each parallaxing element in the container correctly. For example:

```javascript
function Banner() {
  return (
    <Preserve aria-label='illustration of layers of mountains in the distance, trees are in the foreground, the perspective shifts as you move down the page'>
      <Parallax layer={0} id='top'>
        <img src={Ridge0.src} alt='layer-0' />
      </Parallax>
      <Parallax layer={1}>
        <img src={Treeline.src} alt='layer-1' />
      </Parallax>
      <Parallax layer={2}>
        <img src={Ridge1.src} alt='layer-2' />
      </Parallax>
      <Parallax layer={3}>
        <img src={Ridge2.src} alt='layer-3' />
      </Parallax>
      <Parallax layer={4}>
        <img src={Ridge3.src} alt='layer-4' />
      </Parallax>
      <Parallax layer={5}>
        <Box css={{backgroundColor: '$sky', height: 1200, overflow: 'hidden'}} />
      </Parallax>
    </Preserve>
```

<br />

In the above we have 5 layers, 4 svgs and one background Box (div). In each `<Parallax>` we have these styles:

<br />

<div id='parallax-styles' />
```javascript
  export const Parallax = styled('div', {
    position: 'absolute',
    overflowX: 'visible',
    transformOrigin: 'left bottom',
  }
```

<br />

And each layer places itself where it needs to be to construct the image i.e.

<br />

```javascript
    {
      transform: 'translateZ(0px)',
      minWidth: 1500,
      bottom: -200,
    },
```

<figure>layer 0 (in front)</figure>

<br />

```javascript
    {
      transform: 'translateZ(-0.4px) scale(1.4)',
      width: '100vw',
      bottom: -200,
    },
```

<figure>layer 1 (middle)</figure>

```javascript
    {
      transform: 'translateZ(-0.7px) scale(1.7)',
      width: '100vw',
      bottom: -218,
    },
```

<figure>layer 2 (in back)</figure>

<br />

Notice how the scale moves up in relation to the `translateZ` ?
It's so we can move the element back in the "frame" without affecting the size of the specific layer.
Things look smaller when they are far away right? The css is modelling that too, but in this case, we don't want it.
But of course you read this already in the [study material](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/performant-parallaxing/#adjusting-scale-for-perspective).

### Why are you using `bottom` everywhere?

Ok, so now we've hit our first gotcha.
Did you notice the `transformOrigin` in the [parallax base style?](#parallax-styles)
It's set to `left bottom`. This means we are scaling the image from the bottom up. Therefore, it's simpler in my mind to use
the bottom as the reference point for moving the layers around. If you're thinking "what is this, opposite day?" know that it
wasn't my first choice.

In fact, some browsers [don't take into account perspective](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/performant-parallaxing/#assorted-bugs-and-workarounds)
for sizing your elements. So when we apply a scale(2) to counteract the translateZ distance,
the browser acts like the element is _actually_ 2x bigger even if it looks the same as before.
So it will probably push down into your page content if you were working from the top.
The only way to avoid this is to push all that extra height into the beyond a.k.a. the top of your browser window.

<figure>
  <Image
    placeholder='blur'
    width={290}
    height={80}
    quality={10}
    layout='responsive'
    src={MangledBottom}
    alt='picture of elements bleeding through bottom of website'
  />
  If you try to use `top left` you might get something like this at the bottom of your page. Yeah not
  great.
</figure>

### Final Product

So if you've been following along, after a lot of fiddling hopefully you'll have something like this:

<figure style={{width: '50%'}}>
  <Image
    unoptimized={true}
    width={300}
    height={600}
    quality={95}
    src={Recording}
    alt='gif of banner moving'
  />
  Hey, pretty neat.
</figure>

### Except...Gotcha #2

This is how it looks on Chrome:

<figure>
  <Image
    placeholder='blur'
    width={264}
    height={159}
    quality={75}
    layout='responsive'
    src={Artifacts}
    alt='picure of some graphical artifacts'
  />
  Are you f##king kidding me, Chrome?
</figure>

### Fixing it

What worked for me was to fiddle with both the `translateZ` properties as well the positioning.
Just setting `left: -1px` worked to fix a lot of the issues I was having in Chrome. Just experiment, move things slightly back, up/down.
Eventually some configuration works.

Why? You're guess is as good as mine. I read there may be some antialiasing in the background layers causing some layers to not render(?)
I really don't know, the `backfaceVisibility: hidden` was supposed to help with skipping any processing on those obscured layers
but it didn't get rid of all my issues. Just one of those things I guess, maybe I'll file a bug.

### One more Gotcha before you go

It seems scroll performance on Firefox is noticeably worse than the other big players. You can mitigate this by being judicious
in the size of your images. Huge images will tank your scroll performance, it's most noticeable however on FF.

### And we're done!

Boy that was a journey! Well done if you've read this far. Hopefully you learned something, or built something cool,
or maybe you just had fun reading and that's cool too. Bye!
