So ReactWG dropped a [rather large bombshell](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/110) back in October 2021 that seemingly went off unnoticed by many
(including me). The gist of the article is that the React team will not commit to supporting runtime css-in-js libraries for concurrent React going forward.
They now officially recommend you switch to something with static css.

So if you want to use the new concurrent features React 18 brings (and you will), many of the most
popular <nobr>css-in-js</nobr> libraries will likely not work well.

### Kill the Past

While runtime css-in-js libraries are some of the most productive tools to quickly build websites, the
gains in responsiveness that can be acheived with concurrent rendering are too good to miss out on.
Even my newest favorite, Stitches.js, seems to be caught off guard, now even recommending to [use a different library](https://github.com/stitchesjs/stitches/issues/1026).
So with a heavy heart I'm pouring one out for some of my favorite tools. Goodbye Emotion. Goodbye Stitches...so young <nobr>(ಥ﹏ಥ)</nobr>.

You will be missed...

### Hello Vanilla Extract <img src={VEIcon.src} style={{marginBottom: '-0.2rem'}} />

Luckily good ideas spread fast in the software world. There are a number of static css tools already available, with Tailwinds being probably the most popular.
I'm not the biggest fan of Tailwinds, I believe it's a good tool for prototyping but it isn't the best for long-term maintainability or avoiding vendor lock-in.
Linaria is another tool that has some fans, I personally haven't used it but I've heard it can be pain to set up.

The one that's caught my eye is [Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style). It's been gaining a lot of steam lately, and for good reason.
This library uses typescript to preprocess atomic css at the build stage, so any styles you write are typesafe with autocompletion. It has no runtime cost, and
compresses well in your bundle. And the best part? It pretty much steals the variant system from Stitches, which is awesome.

So I went ahead and rewrote this blog from Stitches to Vanilla Extract and I'm mostly pleased with the results.

So far I've found the following:

Pros:

- Variant system is mostly drop-in from Stitches and still awesome.

- Supported by SWC with Next plugin (official docs seems to be out of date on this).

- No more concerns about first load performance as there's no JS to run.

Cons:

- Next plugin seems a little slow at times generating the styles on cold restarts.

- No helpful React integration yet to generate styled components. Must be done manually.

- Styles always need to be in a separate `css.ts` file. For larger projects this may be a net pro.

- You can only use responsive styles with variants (called recipes in VE world) if you have already registered them as atomic classes.
  This is a little annoying if you have a complex layout just for one specific instance.

Overall, while there's a bit more setup and structure, I found it pretty similar for productivity while also being aligned with the future of React.
We don't have to choose between user experience and developer productivity!

Another reminder to my fellow frontend devs to never get too attached to that library you like.
