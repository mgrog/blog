# Hey There!

### Welcome to the new site

Well I finally made a blog. It was a pretty fun (painful?) experience making the banner and content system (maybe I'll write about it)
At any rate, if you like learning about frontend tricks, React, Typescript, Web3 stuff, or Elixir then stay tuned!
I'll have some new posts up here before too long.

P.S. If you're wondering where you've heard the name before, it's based off the show, "Severance".
There, they refine mysterious data. Here, we refine our dev skills :)
